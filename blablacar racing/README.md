## # Introduction :
#### Ladies and Gentlemen ! Here is a rebirth of a video game that you must have played in your childhood . I won't disclose it's name but will assure that playing SPEED RACER  , you will surely get nostalgic .
#### So , take the dare to drive 🚗, compete with friends 👱🏻‍♀️👱🏻‍♂️, set new records 🥇🥈🥉 and enjoy SPEED RACER.

### # How to Play ?
The gameplay is very simple to understand . Just use the left ◀ and right ▶ arrow keys to avoid collision with the other vehicles . Keep an eye on the fuel count , it decreases gradually . Use the left,right arrow keys to collect fuel cans ⛽ which increases the fuel count .

#### And BINGO 🎊 , you are ready to play SPEED RACER .

### # Technology Stack :
The entire code has been written in Python3 . I have used the 👉🏻👉🏻pygame module👈🏻👈🏻 for the entire project(GAME) . All the background music and images are added using the pygame module only .

### # A sneak peek 👀 into the game :

### # Starting the Game :
#### IMPORTANT : I am trying to create an executable file(.exe) of the game so that it becomes independent of all the python and pygame requirements . But I am facing a lot of problems in it . I will try to commit it as soon as possible . Any help and suggestions in this matter will be really helpfull 🙏🏻.
#### Till then you can play the game by just running "Speed Racer.py" . But it requires "python" and "pygame" to be installed on your system .
#### 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 To everyone reading this it's a humble request to please try this game atleast once . It takes bare 5-10 minutes to install python and pygame . And to all the python users - "Installing pygame is a bare 2-3 minutes process" . You just need to enter
pip install pygame on cmd/terminal.

#### # ⚠⚠WARNING⚠⚠ : Don't delete any of the files and always keep the data folder in the same folder as of Speed Racer.py . Else the code will give errors and the game will not start .

## Thank You
